To make it simple to understand, League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battleground Arena (MOBA) style game developed by Riot Games. Each game consists of two teams with 5 players each. Each team starts the game at opposite sides of the arena in a base that contains their Nexus. The goal of each game is to overcome obstacles such as minions, structures and enemy players in order to destroy the enemy Nexus. Each team generally consists of 5 standard positions divided across the map: Top, Middle, Jungle, Attack Damage Carry(ADC)/Marksman and Support. Each player in a match controls a unique champion chosen from a pool of more than a hundred with differing characteristics and abilities.
